## Develop and Operate Microservices on Kubernetes 

```

    - Moving to microservices is not an easy transition for developers who have been building applications using more traditional methods. 
      There are a ton of new concepts and details developers need to become familiar with when they design a distributed application. 
   - walk you through the process of getting familiar with Kubernetes and its way of doing things.
   - Designed to get you through the process of becoming familiar with the Kubernetes environment in order to be 
     able to deploy, configure, and manage the environment where the services    are going to run.
   - real-world experience in working with Kubernetes while building complex distributed architectures. 
   - focus on deploying services that need to store data and learn how Kubernetes Persistent Volumes can be used to 
     create deployments that guarantee data resiliency. 
   - HowTo give services access to connection strings, usernames, passwords, and other sensitive information using Kubernetes Secrets.


## What You Will Learn

 - Manage and deploy containers in Kubernetes 
 - Explore Kubernetes platforms such as pods, deployments, replica sets and secrets 
 - Use both the kubectl (CLI) and Kubernetes dashboard 
 - Set up and use a modern DevOps workflow that takes care of updating existing deployments when new code is checked 
   into the source code repo 
 - Configure and update services after they've been deployed 
 - Use a local development environment with minikube or Kubernetes support in Docker 

 - By the end of the course,  mastered best practices and leveraged some of the latest DevOps technologies to increase agility and
   decrease time-to-market for the services you have built.
