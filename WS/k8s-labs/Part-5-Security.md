**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Lab 1 - RBAC within a namespace</span>**

Implement the following:



*   Create the namespace “rbac-test”
*   Create the service account “rbac-test-sa” for the “rbac-test” namespace
*   Create a role “rbac-test-role” that grants the following pod level resources:
    *   Get
    *   Watch
    *   List
*   Bind the “rbac-test-sa” service account to the “rbac-test-role” role
*   Test RBAC is working by trying to do something the service account is not authorised to do

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Lab 2 - RBAC within a cluster</span>**

Implement the following:



*   Create the user “cluster-user-secretadmin” authenticating with a password
*   Create a role “cluster-role-secretadmin” that grants the following cluster level secret resources:
    *   Get
    *   Watch
    *   List
*   Bind “cluster-user-secretadmin” user to the “cluster-role-secretadmin”

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Lab 3 - Network security policy</span>**



*   Create a nginx pod that listens on port 80, note the IP assigned to it.
*   Create two pods that can use “curl” named busybox1 and busybox2. Note the IP addresses assigned to them. Label them with tier:jumppod
*   Take a interactive shell to busybox1 and run:
    *   Curl [IP Address of nginx pod]. You should get a HTML response.
*   Create a NetworkPolicy rule that blocks all ingress traffic to the nginx pod 
*   Rerun the curl command from busybox1, it should fail.
*   Create a NetworkPolicy that blocks all ingress traffic to the nginx pod with the exception of all pods labelled with tier:jumppod

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Lab 4 - Enable Pod Security Policy</span>**

Configure the admission controller in your cluster to use PodSecurityPolicy

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Lab 5 - Create policies</span>**

Create two pod security policies



*   One named “Privileged” with no restrictions
*   One named “Restricted” with the following restrictions
    *   Cannot run privileged containers
    *   Can only be exposed on port 433

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Lab 6 - Security Context</span>**

Create a pod that defines subsequent containers to run as a user id of 600

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Lab 7 - Secure persistent key value store</span>**



*   Generate a key that will be used to encrypt information located in etcd and create the respective configuration file
*   Modify the API server to leverage a encryption configuration leveraging the key generated in step 1
*   Create a secret called “testsecret” via any applicable means. Verify the contents are encrypted
