[AppArmor Reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/clusters/apparmor/)

```
AppArmor is a Linux kernel security module that supplements the standard Linux user &
group based permissions to confine programs to a limited set of resources.
AppArmor can be configured for any application to reduce its potential attack surface
and provide greater in-depth defense

- securing a pod
- enforce the profile on a Pod
- check that the profile is loaded
- when a profile is violated
- when a profile cannot be loaded

```
