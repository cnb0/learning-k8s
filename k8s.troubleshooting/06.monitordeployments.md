### Monitoring the   Cluster and the Application

```
- The kubectl commands for monitoring applications
- Debugging applications
- Review metrics reported by Kubernetes
- Review metrics from OMS


Monitoring deployed applications on k8s cluster along with monitoring Kubernetes health is essential
to provide reliable service to your customers. There are two primary use cases for monitoring:

- Debugging applications (used mostly when deploying/upgrading apps)
- On-going monitoring to get alerts if something is not behaving as expected


## kubectl get command
To see the overall picture of deployed applications, x provides the get command.
The get command lists the resources that you specify. Resources can be pods, 
replication controllers, ingress, nodes, deployments, secrets, and so on. 
We have already run this in the previous chapters to verify whether our
application is ready to be used or not. Perform the following steps:

1. Run the following get command, which will get us the resources and their statuses:
$kubectl get all

2. Now to view the pods, run the following command:
$kubectl get -w pods

3.To see the history if something goes wrong, run the following command:

$kubectl get events

Kubernetes maintains events for only one hour by default. 
All the commands work only if the event was fired within the past hour.


The general states for a pod are Scheduled->Pulled->Created->Started

```

## kubectl describe command
```
[K8s describe Referece](https://jamesdefabia.github.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl/kubectl_describe/)

The kubectl events command lists all the events for the entire namespace. 
From the description, you can get the node on which the pod is running, 
how long it was running, its internal IP address, docker image name, ports exposed, 
env variables, and the events (within the past hour).

If you are interested in just a pod, you can use the following command:


kubectl describe pods
The preceding command lists all the information about all pods.

If you want information on a particular pod, you can type the following:

kubeclt describe pod/<pod-name>


1.The node section : 
lets us know which physical node/VM that the pod is actually running on. 
If the pod is repeatedly starting or having issues running and everything else seems OK, 
there might be an issue with the node. 
Having this information is essential to perform advanced debugging.


2. The following is the time the pod was initially scheduled:
Start Time: Sun, 10 Feb 2019 05:40:55 +0000

It doesn't mean that the pod has been running from that time. So, 
the time can be misleading in that sense. The actual uptime of the pod would be dependent
on whether it was moved from a node to another, or the node it was on went down.


3.Connections between resources are made using Labels as shown here:

Labels:            app=guestbook
                    pod-template-hash=1341940117
                    tier=frontend
This is how connections such as Service->Deployment->ReplicaSet->Pod are made. 
If you see that traffic is not being routed to a pod from a service, this is the first thing you should check. 
If the labels don't match, the resources won't attach.


4.The following shows the internal IP of the pod and its status:

Status:         Running
IP:                 10.244.0.87
When a service directs its traffic or another container wants to talk to the containers in this pod, 
this is the IP that they will see. This IP is very useful when resolving application issues.
Let's say you want to know why the frontend is not able to reach the server,
you could find the server pod IP and try pinging it from the frontend container.

5.The containers running in the pod and the ports that are exposed are listed in the following block:

Containers:
  php-redis:
...
    Image:          gcr.io/google-samples/gb-frontend:v3
    ...
    Port:           80/TCP
    Host Port:      0/TCP
...
    Environment:
      GET_HOSTS_FROM:                dns
In this case, we are getting the gb-frontend container with the v3 tag from the gcr.io container registry, 
and the repository name is google-samples.

Port 80 is exposed for outside traffic. Since each pod has its own IP, the same port can be exposed for 
multiple containers of the same pod running even on the same host. This is a huge management advantage 
as we don't have to worry about port collisions. The port that needs to be configured is also fixed so that 
scripts can be written simply without the logic of figuring out which port actually got allocated for the pod.

6.Any events that occurred in the previous hour show up here:

Events:
