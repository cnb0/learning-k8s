## k8s Native App Development


developers learn how to build containerized applications 
targeted for enterprise-grade production environments. 
We explore patterns in containerized application architecture, 
techniques for eliminating friction in the development process, 
how to test and debug containerized applications, and 
how to instrument applications with healthchecks,
monitoring tools,and common container logging patterns. 

After mastering these techniques, we turn our attention
to DevOps and building container-native continuous integration
pipelines powered by Jenkins and k8s. 


Motivated to develop container-native applications and 
implement fully containerized CI

k8s Application Essentials, 
        - Familiarity with the Bash shell
        – Filesystem navigation and manipulation
