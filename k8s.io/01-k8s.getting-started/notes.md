[getting started](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/)

You can deploy a Kubernetes cluster on a local machine, cloud, on-prem datacenter, or choose a managed Kubernetes cluster. 

You can also create custom solutions across a wide range of cloud providers, or bare metal environments.

More simply, you can create a Kubernetes cluster in learning and production environments.

1. Learning environment 
                           - Installing Kubernetes with Minikube
                           - Installing Kubernetes with Kind

2. Production environment 

        1. Container runtimes 
                           - Docker (dockershim,dockerd), CRI-O, Containerd, 
                           - frakti (The hypervisor-based container runtime for Kubernetes)

        2. Installing Kubernetes with deployment tools
                            - Bootstrapping clusters with kubeadm
                            - Installing Kubernetes with kops
                            - Installing Kubernetes with Kubespray

        3. Turnkey Cloud Solutions
                            - Running Kubernetes on Alibaba Cloud
                            - Running Kubernetes on AWS EC2
                            - Running Kubernetes on Azure
                            - Running Kubernetes on Google Compute Engine
                            - Running Kubernetes on Multiple Clouds with IBM Cloud Private
                            - Running Kubernetes on Tencent Kubernetes Engine

        4. On-Premises VMs
                            - Cloudstack
                            - Kubernetes on DC/OS
                            - oVirt

        5. Windows in Kubernetes
                            - Intro to Windows support in Kubernetes
                            - Guide for scheduling Windows containers in Kubernetes

        6. Best practices 
                            - Running in multiple zones
                            - Building large clusters
                            - Validate node setup
                            - PKI certificates and requirements
