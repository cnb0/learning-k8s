## [Manual Rotation of CA Certificates](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tls/manual-rotation-of-ca-certificates/)

```
 - how to manually rotate the certificate authority (CA) certificates.

 
 - Rotate the CA certificates manually
    - Make sure to back up your certificate directory along with configuration files and any other necessary files.
    - This approach assumes operation of the Kubernetes control plane in a HA configuration with multiple API servers. 
      Graceful termination of the API server is also assumed so clients  can  cleanly disconnect from one API server and 
      reconnect to another.
    - Configurations with a single API server will experience unavailability while the API server is being restarted.


        - Distribute the new CA certificates and private keys (ex: ca.crt, ca.key, front-proxy-ca.crt, and front-proxy-ca.key) 
          to all your control plane nodes in the Kubernetes certificates directory.

        - Update Kubernetes controller manager's --root-ca-file to include both old and new CA and restart controller manager.
            - Any service account created after this point will get secrets that include both old and new CAs.

        - Update all service account tokens to include both old and new CA certificates.
            - If any pods are started before new CA is used by API servers, they will get this update and trust both old and new CAs.

        - Restart all pods using in-cluster configs (ex: kube-proxy, coredns, etc) 
          so they can use the updated certificate authority data from ServiceAccount secrets.

        - Make sure coredns, kube-proxy and other pods using in-cluster configs are working as expected.
          Append the both old and new CA to the file against --client-ca-file and --kubelet-certificate-authority 
          flag in the kube-apiserver configuration.

        - Append the both old and new CA to the file against --client-ca-file flag in the kube-scheduler configuration.

        - Update certificates for user accounts by replacing the content of client-certificate-data and client-key-data respectively.

               - For information about creating certificates for individual user accounts, 
                 see Configure certificates for user accounts.
               - Additionally, update the certificate-authority-data section in the kubeconfig files, 
                 respectively with Base64-encoded old and new certificate authority data

        - Follow below steps in a rolling fashion.

               - Restart any other aggregated api servers or webhook handlers to trust the new CA certificates.

               - Restart the kubelet by update the file against clientCAFile in kubelet configuration and 
                 certificate-authority-data in kubelet.conf to use both the old and new CA on all nodes.

               - If your kubelet is not using client certificate rotation update client-certificate-data and 
                 client-key-data in kubelet.conf on all nodes along with the kubelet 
                 client certificate file usually found in /var/lib/kubelet/pki.

               - Restart API servers with the certificates 
                  - (apiserver.crt, apiserver-kubelet-client.crt and front-proxy-client.crt) 
                    signed by new CA. 
                   - You can use the existing private keys or new private keys. 
                     If you changed the private keys then update these in the Kubernetes certificates directory as well.

               - Since the pod trusts both old and new CAs, there will be a momentarily 
                 disconnection after which the pod's kube client will reconnect to the new API server
                  that uses the certificate signed by the new CA.
                        - Restart Scheduler to use the new CAs.
                        - Make sure control plane components logs no TLS errors.

                - To generate certificates and private keys for your cluster using the openssl command line tool, 
                  see Certificates (openssl).    You can also use cfssl.

                - Annotate any Daemonsets and Deployments to trigger pod replacement in a safer rolling fashion.

        - If your cluster is using bootstrap tokens to join nodes, update the ConfigMap cluster-info in the kube-public namespace with new CA.

                          $ base64_encoded_ca="$(base64 /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt)"

                          $ kubectl get cm/cluster-info --namespace kube-public -o yaml | \
                                /bin/sed "s/\(certificate-authority-data:\).*/\1 ${base64_encoded_ca}" |  kubectl apply -f -

        - Verify the cluster functionality.

                - Validate the logs from control plane components,  kubelet and the kube-proxy are not throwing any tls errors, 
                  see looking at the logs.
                - Validate logs from any aggregated api servers and pods using in-cluster config.

        - Once the cluster functionality is successfully verified:

               - Update all service account tokens to include new CA certificate only.

               - All pods using an in-cluster kubeconfig will eventually need to be restarted 
                 to pick up the new SA secret for the old CA to be completely untrusted.
                  - restart the control plane components by removing the old CA from the kubeconfig files and 
                    the files against --client-ca-file, --root-ca-file flags resp.

               - restart kubelet by removing the old CA from file against the clientCAFile flag and 
                 kubelet kubeconfig file.
