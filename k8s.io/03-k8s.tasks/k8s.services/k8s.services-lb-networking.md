- Kubernetes networking addresses four concerns:

        - Containers within a Pod use networking to communicate via loopback.
        - Cluster networking provides communication between different Pods.
        - The Service resource lets you expose an application running in Pods to be reachable from outside your cluster.
        - You can also use Services to publish services only for consumption inside your cluster.


            - Service
            - Service Topology
            - EndpointSlices
            - DNS for Services and Pods

            - Connecting Applications with Services
            - Use a Service to Access an Application in a Cluster
            - Connect a Front End to a Back End Using a Service
            - Create an External Load Balancer
            
            - Ingress
            - Ingress Controllers
            - Network Policies
            - Adding entries to Pod /etc/hosts with HostAliases
            - IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack
