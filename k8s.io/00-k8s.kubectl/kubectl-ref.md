###  [kubectl Command line reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands)

- The kubectl command  lets you control Kubernetes clusters. 
  For configuration, kubectl looks for a file named config in the $HOME/.kube directory. 
  You can specify other kubeconfig files by setting the KUBECONFIG environment variable or 
  by setting the --kubeconfig flag.
