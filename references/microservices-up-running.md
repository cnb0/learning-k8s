2. Five Principles
        Why Principles Matter
        Goals and Principles
        People-First Design
        Rightsized Services
        Build-Services-Only
        Single-Cloud Architecture
        12 Factor Development
                1. “One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys”
                2. “Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies”
                3. “Store config in the environment”
                4. “Treat backing services as attached resources”
                5. “Strictly separate build and run stages”
                6. “Execute the app as one or more stateless processes”
                7. “Export services via port binding”
                8. “Scale out via the process model”
                9. “Maximise robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown”
                10. “Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible”
                11. “Treat logs as event streams”
                12. “Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes”

        Set up Terraform Backend Storage
        Setup the Infrastructure as Code Pipeline
        Creating the IaC Repository
        Installing Terraform Locally
        Create a Github Action Workflow
        Setting up our IaC Project
