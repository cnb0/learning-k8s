## Container security

- To facilitate scalability and resilience, many organizations now run applications in cloud native environments using containers and orchestration. 
- how do you know if the deployment is secure? 
- examines key underlying technologies to help developers, operators, and security professionals assess security risks and determine appropriate solutions.

- Explore attack vectors that affect container deployments
- Dive into the Linux constructs that underpin containers
- Examine measures for hardening containers
- Understand how misconfigurations can compromise container isolation
- Learn best practices for building container images
- Identify container images that have known software vulnerabilities
- Leverage secure connections between containers
- Use security tooling to prevent attacks on your deployment
