## k8s patterns 

```
- The way developers design, build, and run software has changed significantly with the evolution of microservices and containers.   
- provide common reusable elements, patterns, principles, and practices for designing and implementing cloud-native applications on Kubernetes

                - Foundational patterns
                        cover the core principles and practices for building container-based cloud-native applications.

                - Behavioral patterns 
                        explore finer-grained concepts for managing various types of container and platform interactions.

                - Structural patterns 
                        help you organize containers within a pod, the atom of the Kubernetes platform.

                - Configuration patterns provide
                        Insight into how application configurations can be handled in Kubernetes.

                - Advanced patterns 
                        Cover more advanced topics such as extending the platform with operators.

V. Advanced Patterns

            22. Controller
                   - Simple, pure shell based controller which watches ConfigMap resources for changes and restarts Pods 
                     by using a label selector provided as annotation. An additional example controller exposes an 
                     Ingress route when it detects an exposeService label attached to the service.

            23. Operator
                   - Operator based on the ConfigMap watch controller and introduces a CRD ConfigWatcher which connects 
                     a ConfigMap with a set of Pods to restart in case of a config change
                   - Custom Resource Definitions

                    -  Scaling Levels

            25. Image Builder
                - Setup a chained build on OpenShift and use Knative build for doing builds within the cluster
                    -  OpenShift Build
