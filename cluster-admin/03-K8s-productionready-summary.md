```
1. Identify the needs of your business
       - How much money and effort do you want to put into HA & security?
2. High Availability != multiple masters 
       - Multiple masters are a requirement for high availability
3. Pay attention to the certiÔ¨Åcate identities for your components
       - And make sure you lock things down well with RBAC, disable  unnecessary ports, etc.
4. Declarative control over your cluster is better than imperative
       - The Cluster API and the GitOps models are worth checking out
