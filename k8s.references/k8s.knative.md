 - how to apply Knative in real enterprise application development. Authors Kamesh Sampath and Burr Sutter include chapters on autoscaling, build and eventing, observability, Knative on OpenShift, and more.

- Efficiently build, deploy, and manage modern serverless workloads
- Apply Knative in real enterprise scenarios, including advanced eventing
- Monitor your Knative serverless applications effectively
- Integrate Knative with CI/CD principles, such as using pipelines for faster, more successful production deployments
- Deploy a rich ecosystem of enterprise integration patterns and connectors in Apache Camel K as Kubernetes and Knative components
