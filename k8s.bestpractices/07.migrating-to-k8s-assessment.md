# Migrating Applications to Kubernetes

```

- Gather Information about the Application
    - Determine Network Interactions
        - What must the service connect to in order to function?
        - What services or users need access to the service?
    - Determine Filesystem Interactions
        - What files and directories are read by the service?
        - What files are modified by the service?
- Use the Data to Plan the Migration
  - the actual migration involves 2 steps
        - Containerization of the processes that make up the application.
        - Selecting the Kubernetes objects that will make up the components of the application
          in the new environment.
          What controller should be used to manage the Pods?
            - Kubernetes has several built-in controllers for managing Pods, and each exhibits slightly 
              different behavior.
                - Deployment 
                - DaemonSet 
                - StatefulSet 
        - How will persistent storage be achieved?
        - How should configuration be injected?
        - How should static files, such as certificates, be managed?
        - How should communication between components via filesystems be handled?
        - How will log data be read from Pods?
        - Does the Kubernetes environment support network policy?
