1 Kubernetes kickoff
            In this workshop we will cover the Kubernetes architecture and way of thinking. 
            We will start the workshop with a theoretical overview of the Kubernetes architecture, 
            way of thinking and general best practices. After that we will continue with the hands-on part - 
            building a real ecommerce system.
            The hands on part has a goal of building a real production-ready ecommerce system, 
            which we evolve from a basic configuration of a Pod running a database and a web server,
            to a scalable system supporting Stateful databases, 
            scalable frontends, networking and ingress.

2 Zero-downtime deployments
            This lab focuses on ensuring reliable deployment and upgrade, scaling, healing and monitoring of 
            your services. We'll cover several powerful Kubernetes mechanisms that facilitate them as well
            as explaining how to fit them in the larger picture of a software delivery process.

3 Advanced networking patterns
            In this lab we'll be doing a deep dive into Kubernetes Networking. 
            Starting by building a strong understanding of the various mechanisms supporting Kubernetes 
            networking abstractions and working through several real world examples 
            which will enable you to architect, build and maintain a production-grade system.

4 Managing stateful applications
            The Managing stateful applications workshop is a whole day workshop designed to teach participants 
            concepts and techniques regarding managing State in Kubernetes.

            As any other resource, Kubernetes abstracts the interface to Storage providers, but additional 
            considerations have to be taken compared to more ephemeral resource like Compute and Memory.

            After being introduced to the Kubernetes storage concepts, this workshop will take participants 
            through a series of exercises covering use-cases using real world technologies.

5 Cluster processes
            This lab focuses on the DevSecOps aspect of running your cluster. We'll be using Kubernetes mechanisms
            like Service Accounts, Pod Security Policies and Network Policies to ensure strict control over 
            utilisation and access to various resources and services of your cluster.â€‹

            This will ensure best practices are enforced by the cluster itself, and reduce the need to reinvent 
            the wheel in various teams.

6 Building a software delivery pipeline
            During this lab we will synthesise all the knowledge from the previous labs to build a unified and
            reactive software delivery pipeline and a monitoring suite. We will be focusing on the big picture of 
            architecting and running your system in a Cloud-native way.
